        <p>An amazing place. The road leading to the hill is very beautiful and the last stretch, just before you reach your destination is too dangerous. Its best if you hire an experienced driver. The trek to the hill top is thrilling.

Tip: Pack lots of food and water, because the climb and climate makes you very hungry, and there is no place to have lunch. Also carry jackets and caps, it gets chilly up hill.</p>
